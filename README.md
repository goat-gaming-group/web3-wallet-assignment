# Technical Assignment: Web3 Wallet Authentication using Next.js

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to authenticate using their Web3 wallets. The site will leverage the Next.js framework and will be developed using JavaScript/Typescript.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to successfully complete this project:

### Frontend

- The site should have a simple, responsive and user-friendly design.
- Users should be able to authenticate using their Web3 wallets.
- Once authenticated, users should be presented with some piece of data fetched from the blockchain.
- Users should be able to log out of the site.

### Backend

- The site should be built using Next.js.
- The site should use an EVM compatible blockchain network to authenticate users.
- The site should be able to retrieve data from the chosen blockchain network and display it to users.
- The site should be able to log users out and destroy any session data.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables must be submitted upon completion of the project:

### Source Code

All source code for the site, including both frontend and backend code.

### Testing and Deployment

The site should be fully tested and delivered on a live shareable environment (i.e. a URL).

## Bonus

The following additional bonus is here to inspire you, and may help you justify your decisions during technical review:

### Technical Specification

A technical specification outlining the architecture of the site, including design, functionality, and security considerations.
